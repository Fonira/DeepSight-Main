AI USAGE DISCLOSURE
This app uses artificial intelligence in the following ways:
• Mistral AI — For generating video summaries, analysis, flashcards, quizzes, and contextual chat responses
• Perplexity AI — For fact-checking claims and retrieving external sources
• Text-to-Speech — For audio synthesis of summaries

All AI-generated content is clearly labeled with Bayesian certainty markers (Solid, Plausible, Uncertain, Verify) to indicate confidence levels. Users are encouraged to verify claims independently.

No AI is used for user profiling, biometric analysis, or automated decision-making that affects users.
