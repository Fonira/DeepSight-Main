DeepSight transforms how you watch YouTube. Powered by artificial intelligence and Bayesian epistemology, every video becomes a reliable, structured source of knowledge.

INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS
Paste a YouTube link and instantly get a detailed summary. Our AI identifies key ideas, arguments, and the logical structure of each video. Three analysis modes — accessible, standard, and expert — adapt to your level.

FACT-CHECKING WITH SOURCES
Every claim is evaluated with Bayesian certainty markers:
• SOLID — Established fact, scientific consensus
• PLAUSIBLE — Probable but needs confirmation
• UNCERTAIN — Hypothesis, ongoing debate
• VERIFY — Doubtful claim, check independently
External sources are provided so you can verify for yourself.

STUDY TOOLS
• Auto-generated flashcards to memorize key concepts
• Interactive quizzes to test your understanding
• Concept glossary with contextual definitions
• Visual mind maps to connect ideas

CONTEXTUAL CHAT
Ask questions about the analyzed video and get precise answers based on its content. The AI understands the full context of the video for relevant responses.
